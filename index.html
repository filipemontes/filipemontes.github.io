                <p>
                    EasyApply ‚Äì App for who is seeking a Job in the easiest way!

                    I‚Äôve recently finished my bachelor's in Data Science and am now seeking my first job or internship opportunity. It's very challenging because the market is highly competitive, with hundreds of submissions for every position. I find myself spending a lot of time searching for opportunities, and I wondered: Is it possible to automate that first part of finding jobs?

                    So, I built this app.
                </p>

                <h4>EasyApply 0.1</h4>

                <p>
                    <strong>How it works:</strong><br>
                    EasyApply (0.1) was built using <strong>Streamlit</strong> and connects directly to your LinkedIn account. Once logged in, you can input a keyword like "Data Science." In this case, LinkedIn itself will look for related jobs that the user might also be interested in. In the next version of EasyApply I intend to refine the job options to better match the user‚Äôs preferences and further regulate the jobs the app finds, using keywords not only in the title but also in the description. The application then automatically searches LinkedIn for job postings that match the criteria.
                </p>

                </div>

                <p>
                    When a job is found, the app opens the application modal and auto-fills the form fields such as email, phone number, uploads your CV, and sends the job offer. If a cover letter is required, the app doesn't send the application and instead notifies the user to create one manually.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This dramatically reduces the time spent on repetitive applications and helps ensure you don't miss relevant opportunities.
